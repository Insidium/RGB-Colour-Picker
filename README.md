# RGB Colour Picker

Hello World!

This is a web based guessing game using the RGB colour index. Players consider the red, green and blue saturations and guess which tile shows the correct RBG colour.

This is created with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. While simple in construction, it is a chance for me to build something more substantial with my foundation skills.

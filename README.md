# RGB Colour Picker

Hello World!

This is a web based guessing game using the RGB colour index. Players consider the red, green and blue saturations (as indicated in the heading - RGB(X, X, X)) and select which tile they believe shows the correct RGB colour.

There is an 'Easy Mode' (3 tiles) and a 'Hard Mode' (6 tiles). The player can also choose to reset the tiles to new colours should they not like the range.

The game notifies the player if they choose incorrectly and removes each such choice from the board. If the player chooses the correct colour, the game will stop, notify the player and change all tiles and the header to that colour.

This is created with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. While simple in construction, it is a chance for me to build something with more substantial logic.
